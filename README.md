## Introduction

Falls are a leading cause of injuries among the elderly and other vulnerable groups. Existing detection methods are often intrusive and ineffective. This project provides a **real-time, non-intrusive fall detection system** that uses **enhanced YOLOv8** for high accuracy and reliability. It also integrates with Telegram to send instant alerts.

## Features

- **Real-Time Detection**: Detects falls in real-time from video streams.
- **Non-Intrusive**: Works passively without interfering with the user's daily activities.
- **High Accuracy**: Leveraging YOLOv8 with custom optimizations.
- **Alerts System**: Sends instant notifications via Telegram.
- **Customizable Confidence Threshold**: Control sensitivity by adjusting detection thresholds.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Powered by Gradio for easy video uploads and annotated results.

## Technologies Used

- **YOLOv8**: For object detection and classification.
- **Gradio**: To create a user-friendly web interface.
- **OpenCV**: For video processing and visualization.
- **Python**: Core language for implementation.
- **Telegram Bot API**: For real-time notifications.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- pip (Python package manager)
- A GPU with CUDA support (optional for faster inference)

### Steps

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
   cd your-repo-name
2. Install required packages:
    ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
3. Configure Telegram Bot:
   Replace the placeholders in the script with your bot token and chat ID.

## Usage
### Running the Application
1. Start the Gradio interface:
   ```bash
   Copy code
   python app.py
2. Upload a video through the Gradio UI.
3. Annotated video results will be displayed in the interface, and Telegram alerts will be sent if falls are detected.

## How It Works
1. **Input Video**: The user uploads a video of an environment to be monitored.
2. **YOLOv8 Inference**: Each frame is analyzed for falls using a pre-trained YOLOv8 model.
3. **Threshold Filtering**: Detections below a set confidence threshold are discarded to reduce false positives.
4. **Alerts**: If a fall is detected, an alert is sent via Telegram.
5. **Output Video**: The system generates an annotated video showing detected falls.
